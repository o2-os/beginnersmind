<p>241010 It's a bizarre feeling not knowing where to begin, suspended in a state of actionlessness but propelled forward by the unceasing force of a will to survive, as well as a will for something greater than that. When I evaulate my choices, I only see a web of dazzling complexity beyond my ability to possibly determine whether I have any control or I do not. All I know, is there is that desire for something more. That longing leaves you questioning whether or not your small time has been spent with intention, purpose, meaning... if it was simply a choice of action or non-action, then I have failed. But why do I still want it? Is it a matter of non-acceptance? Or is there really something more..
